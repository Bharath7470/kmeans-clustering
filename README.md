# Task 8: K-Means Clustering â€“ Mall Customer Segmentation

This project applies K-Means clustering to segment mall customers based on their income and spending score.

## âœ… What's Done
- Data preprocessing and standardization
- KMeans clustering applied with scikit-learn
- Elbow Method used to find optimal k
- Evaluated with Silhouette Score
- Final cluster visualized using seaborn

## ðŸ§ª Best Result
- Optimal k = 5
- Silhouette Score â‰ˆ 0.55

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (KMeans, silhouette_score)
